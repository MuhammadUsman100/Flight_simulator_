basic craft controles (according to bonus requirements).
creating a set of bullets in array  before game start in @craft shooting script. (object pulling)
craft is shooting properly on its aim which is red dot(note: i try my best to place  enemies on building but i  blank .if you give me some tutorial how to place enemies then i will do it .so because of that i set the repositry clone to make changes).
controles(W is for forward , s is for backward,mouse movement is for rotation )
